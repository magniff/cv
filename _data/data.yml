    title: WHOAMI
    summary: |
      In the past, I was a big proponent of dynamic languages, but over time I became disillusioned with them.
      Several years ago I got acquainted with academic research on static typing, learned about Curry-Howard isomorphism, calculus of inductive constructions, and languages like Agda and Idris.
      I like it when decisions are made with a solid, preferably academic foundation.
      At the same time, it gives me pleasure to achieve clear and demonstrable results in the shortest possible time.
      Now I run a small group of pythonista inside the department of Positive Technologies, that develops one of company's key products - MaxPatrolX.
