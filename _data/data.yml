    summary: |
        My expertise lies in managing distributed systems and I possess a good understanding of consensus algorithms such as 2pc, Raft, and Paxos.
        Additionally, I am passionate about programming languages and enjoy exploring the development of virtual machines, compilers, and type systems.
        I regularly work on personal projects using Haskell, OCaml, and Rust, while also having experience with C#, Kotlin, and Dart (Flutter).
        I have spoken at numerous Python events and have even co-organized one of them. You can find some of my talks listed at the bottom of this page.
